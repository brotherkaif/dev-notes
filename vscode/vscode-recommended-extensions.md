## Recommended Extensions

Repositories can contain a [Recommended Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions) file that is automatically loaded by VSCode when you open this repository. This file provides VSCode with a simple method of installing all of the extensions that a team uses to work with the repository effectively. Details on the extensions we use can be found below.

### How is this configured?

Via the `extensions.json` file which is located at `.vscode/extensions.json`. For further information on how to configure this file, please refer to the [Recommended Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions) documentation.

### How do I install the recommended extensions?

From the menu bar, click `Code > Preferences > Extensions`. In the search bar, type `@recommended`. A list of "Workpace Recommendations" will appear that list out the extensions we use. From here you can choose to install all of the extensions in one go, or install them individually.
