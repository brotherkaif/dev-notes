## Workspace Settings

Repositories can contain a [Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_workspace-settings) file that is automatically loaded by VSCode when you open this repository. This file will override some settings when working with this repository. This is done to maintain consistency and collaboration with other contributers to this repository.

### How is this configured?

Via the `settings.json` file which is located at `.vscode/settings.json`. For further information on how to configure this file, please refer to the [Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_workspace-settings) documentation.

### Will my personal VSCode settings be overwritten?

No. **Your personal settings are safe and will not be permanantly modified!** These settings only apply when opening this specific repository in VSCode.

### What settings are applied?

From the menu bar, click `Code > Preferences > Settings`. From there, you can click on the `Workspace` tab to view the settings (you may want to filter by "Modified" to help find the settings in question).
