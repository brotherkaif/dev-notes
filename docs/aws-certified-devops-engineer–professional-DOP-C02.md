### CodeCommit

#### CI/CD Concepts

**What problems are we trying to solve?:**
These types of projects are slow, not iterative and have long release cycles.

**How do we merge the goals of Dev and Ops?:**
The traditional goals of software development and IT operations do not really align.

- **Dev:** _How many changes, features and defects can we push into production and how quickly can we do it?_
- **Ops:** _We want stable and available systems!_

**How can we solve these problems?:**
DevOps. _Shorten dev lifecycle._ Deliver features, fixes and updates frequently.

```

**What is CI/CD?:**

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment? Are they the same thing?:**
No, they are not the same thing.

```mermaid
timeline
    SOURCE CODE : Continuous Integration
    TEST : Continuous Integration
    BUILD : Continuous Integration
    QA 
    RELEASE 
```

**Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of continuous devivery_.

```mermaid
timeline
    SOURCE CODE
    TEST
    BUILD : Continuous Deployment
    QA : Continuous Deployment
    RELEASE : Continuous Deployment
```

**Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

```mermaid
timeline
    SOURCE CODE
    TEST
    BUILD : Continuous Delivery
    QA : Continuous Delivery
       : STOP
    RELEASE : Deploy
```


**Developer Tools on AWS**

- **CodeCommit:** For our repository
- **CodeBuild:** For our build
- **CodeDeploy:** For our deployment
- **CodePipeline:** Automate and manage the above services

##### Key Points

- **Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of Continuous Delivery_.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

#### CodeCommit Overview

##### Key Points

> NOTE: Amazon has announced that CodeCommit is being deprecated [(read announcement)][codecommit-deprecation]. Whilst that renders this entire section redundant, it is still worth understanding the concepts as in a lot of cases, the CodeCommit repo can simply be swapped out with another third party git host.

**What is CodeCommit?:**
It is a _managed service_ that hosts private Git repositories.

**Why not just use Git?:**
Well, you can. But the key term is _managed service_.

##### Benefits

- Highly available, scalable and fault tolerant
- No size limit
- Integrates with other AWS services (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Lambda, SNS)
- Works with existing Git-based tools

##### Exam Tips

- CodeCommit has many benefits but _is not the only repository_ you can use in an AWS deployment pipeline.
- When in CodeCommit (or CodeBuild and CodeDeploy) in the AWS Management Console, _study the dropdowns_.
- Other repositories that can be used in AWS deployments include _S3_, _GitHub_, _Bitbucket_ and _GitHub Enterprise_.

[codecommit-deprecation]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/how-to-migrate-your-aws-codecommit-repository-to-another-git-provider/

#### CodeCommit Repository Actions

##### AWS CLI Command Review

The following AWS CLI commands can be used to interact with CodeCommit repositories

- List Repositories: `aws codecommit list-repositories`
- Create Repository: `aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Get (View) Repository: `aws codecommit get-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Delete Repository: `aws codecommit delete-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`

##### Exam Tips

- If asked to select the proper command, note that the majority of these commands are very literal.

#### CodeCommit Cloning, Commit, Pushes and Pulls

##### Exam Tips

- **Commit:** Understand that commit is committing changes to your local repository. _To get these changes to the main repository, you need to do a push._
- **Order of Operations:**
  - _Make_ changes to local files.
  - _Commit_ changes to your local repo.
  - _Push_ changes to a remote repo.

#### CodeCommit Merging and Branching

- **What's the problem?:** Our developers are making changes in the same file to the same lines of code. _This cuases a conflict and needs to be sorted out._
- **What's the solution?:** _The merge process_ will help to resolve these conflicts and keep our code and our team on the same page.
- **What are Branches?:** An independant line of development. They allow us to safely make changes to code without disrupting the code on the main branch.
- **Why Branches?:**
  - To build a new feature
  - To fix bugs
  - Without disrupting the main branch

##### Exam Tips

- Three things to remember when it comes to Branches
  - Separate work
  - Work on new features
  - Create a bug fix branch

#### CodeCommit Data Security

**Use CodeCommit when you need:**

- Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Managed service AWS secures
- Highly available and scalable

**Data Security Scenario**
Q: You want your development team to have full access to CodeCommit, but they should not be able to create or delete repositories.
A: Attach the AWSCodeCommit PowerUser policy to the account of each developer. Or better yet, create an IAM group to manage the developers in one place and attach that policy to the group.

##### Exam Tips

- **CodeCommit Tip:** Repositories are automatically _encrypted at rest_.
- **Repositories Tip:** Repositories _are also encrypted in transit_ using either HTTPS, SSH or both (configurable at setup).

                            |                   |                   |
                            .                   .                   .
```

**Securing Repositories and Branches**

- **Use Case:** By default, any CodeCommit repository user who has sufficient permissions to push code to the repository can contribute to any branch in that repository. This has caused some problems and we need to limit pushes to prod to our Admins.
- **Solution:** We can create an IAM policy (or a group with a policy attached) that allows only certain users to push to the prod branch.

**Replicating Repositories Between Regions**

```
Q: How can we replicate a CodeCommit Repository across regions?

A: Create a trust, a service role that allows us to work in region 2.
   You could set up a step in your pipeline triggers a Lambda that
   executes a `git:push` to the repository in the other region.

   +-----------------------------------------------------+                        +----------------+
   |Region 1                                             |                        |Region 2        |
   |                                                     |                        |                |

```

**Key Repository Steps**

1. Migrate a Git repository to CodeCommit
2. Branch the repository
3. Limit who can push to the `prod` repository with an IAM policy
4. Set up a pipeline to replicate our repository across regions

### CodeBuild

#### Introduction to CodeBuild

**What is CodeBuild?**

**Fully managed** continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

**How do we access CodeBuild?**

- Management console
- CLI
- SDK
- CodePipeline

```
    SOURCE               BUILD
+------------+       +-----------+
|            |       |           | - Fully managed
|            |       |           | - No need to provision /
| CodeCommit +------>| CodeBuild |   scale servers
|            |       |           | - Prepackaged build
|            |       |           |   environments
+------------+       +-----+-----+
                           |

                        +------+
                        |      | - Versioning
                        |  S3  | - Encryption
                        |      |
                        +------+
                        ARTIFACT
```

##### Exam Tips

- **How can CodeBuild be used?:**
  - It can be added to the _build stage_ and also the test stage _in a pipeline_.
  - You must provide CodeBuild _with a build project_.
- **What is a build project?:**
  - _A build project includes_ information about how to run a build, including where to get the source code, which build environment to use, which build commands to run, and where to store the build output.

#### CodeBuild Walkthrough

##### Steps

1. Provide CodeBuild with a _Build Project_. This will tell CodeBuild how to perform the build itself (where to get the source, what environments to use, what commands to use, where to store the build output etc.).
2. CodeBuild uses the _Build Project_ to create the _Build Environment_.
3. _Source Code_ is downloaded into the _Build Environment_ and uses the _Build Specification_ (Buildspec) file. The Buildspec is a collection of build commands and related settings that CodeBuild uses to run a build.
4. CodeBuild sends the output of a build to our output repository (usually S3). We can also set up notifications and have an SNS topic that gets updated when a new build output is put onto the S3 bucket.
5. Build runs. Information can be send to CloudWatch and also back to CodeBuild regarding the status of the build.
6. Build can be monitored with the tool of our choice (Management Console, CLI, SDK etc.).

Remember, the _input_ is the _Source Code_ (which in turn could be considered the _output_ of the _Source_ step in the pipeline), and _outputs_ (the artifacts generated by the build process) are usually sent to S3 and become the _input_ for the next step (likely CodeDeploy, but other build systems can be used).

**NOTE:** As input, you must provide CodeBuild with a build project.

##### Use Cases

**Ask yourself:**

_Do you need to run CodeBuild after a successful merge to CodeCommit?_

Set up CloudWatch to monitor for merges to CodeCommit and then trigger a build in CodeBuild.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1["DEV"] --> id2["CodeCommit"]
    id3["CloudWatch/EventBridge Events"] --> id2
    id3 --> id4["CodeBuild"]
```

**You're given a new requirement:**

_You need to review CodeBuild logs and notify personnel of new logs._

- _Send CodeBuild logs to_ to CloudWatch Logs.
- _Set up a CloudWatch Event_ to monitor for new logs.
- _Trigger a Lambda function_ to send a notification to Slack.

**NOTE:** CloudWatch Events has recently been re-branded to EventBridge Events

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1["Codebuild"] --> id2["CloudWatch Logs"]
    id3["CloudWatch/EventBridge Events"] --> id4["Lambda"] --> id5["Slack"]
```

- **Input**: You must provide CodeBuild _with a build project_.
- **Output**: If there is any build output (artifacts), the build environment _uploads its output to an S3 bucket_.

##### Exam Tips

- Do you need a _build stage_?:
  - Only if your code artifacts need to be built/packaged. (e.g. For Java, you build a JAR file; whereas simple HTML does not need to be built.)
- What is a _buildspec_?:
  - _A collection of build commands and related settings_, in YAML format, the CodeBuild uses to run a build.

#### Working with Build Projects and the Buildspec File

##### Orchestrating Builds Using the Buildspec File

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1["Source Code"] --> id2["Build Project (Build Environment)"]
    id3["Buildspec"] <--> id2
    id2 --> id4["S3"]
    id4 --> id5["CodeDeploy"]
```

##### Steps in a Build Project

1. Submitted
2. Provisioning (build servers)
3. Download Source
4. Install
5. Pre-Build
6. Build
7. Post-Build
8. Upload Artifacts
9. Finalising
10. Completing

##### Let's Talk Buildspec

**What is a Buildspec?**

A buildspec is a **collection of build commands and related settings**, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build.

**How does a buildspec file work with the build environment?**

You can include a buildspec as part of the **source code or you can define a buildspec** when you create a build project.

**What benefits are there to using a buildspec file?**

**Without a buildspec**, CodeBuild cannot successfully convert your build input into build output or locate the build output artifact in the build environment to upload to your output bucket.

**NOTE:** **If you include a buildspec as part of the output, by default,** the buildspec file must be named `buildspec.yml` and placed in the root of your source directory.

**NOTE:** **You can specify only 1 buildspec** for a build project, regardless of the buildspec file's name.

##### Example Buildspec File

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 10
    commands:
      - echo Installing app dependencies...
      - yarn install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building static site...
      - yarn build
      - echo Run tests...
      - CI=true yarn test

artifacts:
  type: zip
  paths:
    - './build/**/*'
    - './cicd/**/*'

cache:
  paths:
    - './node_modules/**/*'
```

##### Exam Tips

Here are some questions to ask when it comes to **planning a build**.

- Where's the source code?
- Which build commands and in what order?
- Which runtimes and tools are needed?
- Is a service role needed to work with other AWS services?
- Is CodeBuild working with your VPC?
  - What do you need?
    - VPC ID
    - Security groups
    - Subnet IDs

#### CodeBuild Advanced

##### Running CodeBuild Locally

You don't need LocalStack to run CodeBuild locally (e.g. for testing a complex buildspec); It would actually be overkill. Instead use the **CodeBuild Agent**.

**Benefits**

- Test the `buildspec.yml` before actually using it in AWS CodeBuild projects.
- Test and build applications locally before committing the changes.
- Identify, fix, and experiment with things quickly.

###### Steps

1. Install `git` on your local machine.
2. Install and set up Docker on your local machine.
3. Set up the build image - you can pull it from the CodeBuild public Amazon ECR repository.
4. Download the CodeBuild Agent.
5. Run the CodeBuild Agent.

##### CodeBuild with VPC

**Use Cases**

Run integration tests from your build against data in an Amazon RDS database that's isolated on a private subnet.

Query data in an Amazon ElastiCache cluster directly from tests.

Interact with internal web services hosted on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, or services that use internal Elastic Load Balancing.

##### CodeBuild Environment Variables

AWS CodeBuild provides several environment variables that you can use in your build commands:

- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (for CLI)
- `AWS_REGION` (for SDK)
- `CODEBUILD_BATCH_BUILD_IDENTIFIER`
- `CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN`

**Can we store the Access Key in these variables?**

**This should not be used for sensitive data.** You can use Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for that kind of data.

##### Automated Code Review on Pull Requests

1. Developer raises a pull request against the `main` branch of the source code repository.
2. The pull requests event is received by the default event bus.
3. The default event bus triggers the EventBridge rule.
4. The EventBridge rule triggers the CodeBuild project.
5. The AWS CodeBuild project runs the code quality check and sends the results back to the pull request as comments. The AWS CodeBuild project approves or rejects the pull request automatically.

### CodeDeploy

#### Introduction to CodeDeploy

**Step 1:** **Provision an IAM user with access to CodeDeploy** (attach a CodeDeploy policy to the user).

**Step 2:** Create an **IAM instance profile** to allow EC2 to access your repositories.

**Step 3:** Create an IAM service role that will grant CodeDeploy access to **other AWS resources**.

##### Exam Tips

- The most common repository for CodeDeploy artifacts: S3
- EC2/on-premises deployments can also use GitHub or BitBucket

#### CodeDeploy Setup and Configuration

- **What to Deploy:** Revisions (e.g. "Revision 1", "Revision 2 etc.)
- **How to Deploy and at What Rate:** Deployment Configuration
- **Where to Deploy:** Deployment Group

##### Going a Step Further: Adding Automation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    id1[CodeDeploy] <--> id2[EventBridge]
    id2 --> id3[SNS]
    id2 --> id4[Lambda]
```

##### What You Can Deploy

- Scripts
- Code
- Serverless Lambda Functions
- Executable Packages
- Web and Configuration Files
- Media Files

**Note:** Depending on what you're deploying, you may not need a build stage (CodeBuild) at all.

##### How to Deploy

CodeDeploy can deploy application content that runs on a server and is stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. CodeDeploy can also deploy a serverless Lambda function.

**The deployment method you choose will determine the rate of deployment.**

##### Where to Deploy

1. EC2/On-Premises
2. AWS Lambda
3. Amazon ECS

##### Exam Tips

3 things to remember about **Automating Notifications**:

1. **Use EventBridge** (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) to detect the result of a CodeDeploy job.
2. The event can **trigger SNS or Lambda**
3. **Targets can be email or other apps** such as Slack

#### CodeDeploy Application, Deployment Groups, and Deployment Configurations

What is an **Application**?:
In CodeDeploy, and application is simply **a named identifier** used to **reference your deployment settings**.

What is a **Deployment Group**?:
It is the instance or instances where you want to **target and deploy your code**.

What is a **Deployment Configuration**?:
It is the **number of instances** (which you can select at any time) for which **you want to deploy your code**.

##### Deployment Steps

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  id1["Create Application"] --> id2["Specify Deployment Group"] --> id3["Specify Deployment Configuration"] --> id4["Upload Revision"] --> id5["Deploy"] --> id6["Check Results"] --> id7["Redeploy as needed"]
```

##### Default Deployment Options

- One at a time
- All at once
- Half at a time

##### Exam Tips

**EC2 Deployment Group:** **A set of individual instances** targeted for a deployment.

Understand the options available for **each type of deployment group**: [Working with deployment configurations in CodeDeploy (AWS Docs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.html)

#### CodeDeploy `appspec.yml`

##### AppSpec Overview

```mermaid
flowchart LR
id1["Deployable Content + AppSpec File"] --> id2["CodeDeploy"] --> id3["Deployment Group"]
```

What is the **AppSpec file?**:
An application specification file (AppSpec file), which is unique to CodeDeploy, is a ***YAML or JSON formatted file**.

What is the **file structure?**:
The AppSpec file is **used to manage each deployment as a series** of lifecycle event hooks, which are defined in the file.

##### Example `appspec.yaml` for EC2

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /index.html
    destination: /var/www/html/
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/install_dependencies
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
    - location: scripts/start_server
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/stop_server
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

##### Exam Tips

**Need to run custom actions during a deployment?**
Think **AppSpec file** and **lifecycle hooks** in the AppSpec.

#### CodeDeploy Revision and Deployment

##### What is an Application Revision?

**A revision is simply the bundle (ZIP/TAR file)** containing the current group of files you want to deploy.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1["CodeDeploy"] --> id2["S3"]
```

##### Revision Steps

1. **Select a repository** type in which to store the bundled source code.
2. **Bundle the source** files and push then to the selected repository.

##### How Can We Deploy a Revision?

##### Exam Tips

**LifeCycle Event Hooks:** Similar to Auto Scaling, **CodeDeploy has lifecycle hooks.**

**Hooks:** The hooks section for an EC2/on-premises deployment contains mappings that link deployment lifecycle event hooks to 1 or more scripts. The hooks allow you to **run custom code at various times** during deployment (`BeforeInstall`, `AfterInstall` etc.).

More info: [AppSpec 'hooks' section (AWS Docs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.html)

**Some Questions to Consider:**

- Have you created an **application**?
- Have you created a **deployment group**?
- Have you created a **deployment configuration**?

#### CodeDeploy with Lambda

##### Deployment Workflow

```

##### Example `appspec.yaml` for Lambda

```yaml
version: 0.0
Resources:
  - myLambdaFunction:
      Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
      Properties:
        Name: "myLambdaFunction"
        Alias: "myLambdaFunctionAlias"
        CurrentVersion: "1"
        TargetVersion: "2"
Hooks:
  - BeforeAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateBeforeTrafficShift"
  - AfterAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateAfterTrafficShift"
```

##### More on Hooks in the AppSpec

**What are we doing with a Lambda Function in Hooks?:**

Revisiting that snippet above, note `Validate`. The Lambda functions are performing validation.

```yaml
Hooks:
  - BeforeAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateBeforeTrafficShift"
  - AfterAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateAfterTrafficShift"
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  id1["Start"]:::red --> id2["BeforeAllowTraffic"]:::green --> id3["AllowTraffic"]:::red --> id4["AfterAllowTraffic"]:::green --> id5["End"]:::red

  classDef red stroke:#f00
  classDef green stroke:#0f0
```

**Note*:* Items highlighted in red cannot be scripted
