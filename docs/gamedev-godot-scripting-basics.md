# GAMEDEV: Godot Scripting Basics

## Core Building Blocks
There are four tools and features that are at the core of every game you will make with the engine.

These are:
1. **Nodes**, which are like the base Lego blocks you use to build your game. They are a base object type defined in the engine.
2. **Scenes** are templates made of multiple nodes, which you can save and create reproductions of in your game.
3. A Godot game is a tree of scene instances, which is called the **scene tree**.
4. To make multiple nodes communicate within or across scenes, Godot provides a built-in tool named **signals**, its version of the popular Observer programming pattern.
