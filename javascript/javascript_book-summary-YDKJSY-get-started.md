## Chapter 1: What is JavaScript

### About This Book
- _Knowing JS_ is not a destination, it's a direction.
- **Not intended as a beginner/intro book**.
- **A good start always depends on a solid first step**.

### What's With That Name?
- The name JavaScript is probably the most misunderstood programming language name.
- Official name is **ECMAScript**.
- It's most definitely _not_ a variant of the Java language!

### Language Specification
- TC39 is the technical steering committee that manages JS.
- You can learn **one JS**, and rely on the same JS everywhere.

#### The Web Rules Everything About (JS)
- JS runs in a lot of places, but the one environment that rules JS is the web.
- Wherever possible, adhere to the JS specification and don't rely on behaviour that's only applicable to certain JS engine environments.

#### Not All (Web) JS

#### It's Not Always JS

### Many Faces

### Backwards & Forwards
- **JS is not forwards compatible**.

#### Jumping the Gaps

#### Filling the Gaps

### What's in an Interpretation
- **JS is a parsed language**.
- **JS is a compiled language**.

#### Web Assembly (WASM)

### _Strictly_ Speaking
- The **only** valid reason for using strict mode per function is if you are converting a large codebase incrementally.
