## SDLC Automation

### CI-CD Concepts

**What problems are we trying to solve?:**
These types of projects are slow, not iterative and have long release cycles.

**How do we merge the goals of Dev and Ops?:**
The traditional goals of software development and IT operations do not really align.

- **Dev:** _How many changes, features and defects can we push into production and how quickly can we do it?_
- **Ops:** _We want stable and available systems!_

**How can we solve these problems?:**
DevOps. _Shorten dev lifecycle._ Deliver features, fixes and updates frequently.

**How does DevOps look in action?:**

```

**What is CI/CD?:**

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment? Are they the same thing?:**

```

**Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of continuous devivery_.
**Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

### CodeCommit Overview

#### Key Points

**What is CodeCommit?:**

It is a _managed service_ that hosts private Git repositories.

**Why not just use Git?:**

Well, you can. But the key term is _managed service_.

#### Benefits

- Highly available, scalable and fault tolerant
- No size limit
- Integrates with other AWS services (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Lambda, SNS)
- Works with existing Git-based tools

#### Exam Tips

- CodeCommit has many benefits but _is not the only repository_ you can use in an AWS deployment pipeline.
- When in CodeCommit (or CodeBuild and CodeDeploy) in the AWS Management Console, _study the dropdowns_.
- Other repositories that can be used in AWS deployments include _S3_, _GitHub_, _Bitbucket_ and _GitHub Enterprise_.

### CodeCommit Repository Actions

#### AWS CLI Command Review

The following AWS CLI commands can be used to interact with CodeCommit repositories

- List Repositories: `aws codecommit list-repositories`
- Create Repository: `aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Get (View) Repository: `aws codecommit get-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Delete Repository: `aws codecommit delete-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`

#### Exam Tips

- If asked to select the proper command, note that the majority of these commands are very literal.

### CodeCommit Cloning, Commit, Pushes and Pulls

#### Exam Tips

- Commit: Understand that commit is committing changes to your local repository. _To get these changes to the main repository, you need to do a push._
- Order of Operations:
    - _Make_ changes to local files.
    - _Commit_ changes to your local repo.
    - _Push_ changes to a remote repo.

### CodeCommit Merging and Branching

- **What's the problem?:** Our developers are making changes in the same file to the same lines of code. _This cuases a conflict and needs to be sorted out._
- **What's the solution?:** _The merge process_ will help to resolve these conflicts and keep our code and our team on the same page.
- **What are Branches?:** An independant line of development. They allow us to safely make changes to code without disrupting the code on the main branch.
- **Why Branches?:**
    - To build a new feature
    - To fix bugs
    - Without disrupting the main branch

#### Exam Tips

- Three things to remember when it comes to Branches
    - Separate work
    - Work on new features
    - Create a bug fix branch

### CodeCommit Data Security

- Use CodeCommit when you need:
    - Data encrypted in transit and at rest
    - Managed service AWS secures
    - Highly available and scalable

**Data Security Scenario**
Q: You want your development team to have full access to CodeCommit, but they should not be able to create or delete repositories.
A: Attach the AWSCodeCommit PowerUser policy to the account of each developer. Or better yet, create an IAM group to manage the developers in one place and attach that policy to the group.

#### Exam Tips

- CodeCommit Tip: Repositories are automatically _encrypted at rest_.
- Repositories Tip: Repositories _are also encrypted in transit_ using either HTTPS, SSH or both (configurable at setup).

### Introduction to CodeBuild

**What is CodeBuild?**
Fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

**How do we access CodeBuild?**
- Management console
- CLI
- SDK
- CodePipeline

```
    SOURCE               BUILD
+------------+       +-----------+
|            |       |           | - Fully managed
|            |       |           | - No need to provision /
| CodeCommit +------>| CodeBuild |   scale servers
|            |       |           | - Prepackaged build
|            |       |           |   environments
+------------+       +-----+-----+
                           |
                           |
                           v
                        +------+
                        |      | - Versioning
                        |  S3  | - Encryption
                        |      |
                        +------+
                        ARTIFACT
```

#### Exam Tips

- How can CodeBuild be used?:
    - It can be added to the _build stage_ and also the test stage _in a pipeline_.
    - You must provide CodeBuild _with a build project_.
- What is a build project?:
    - _A build project includes_ information about how to run a build, including where to get the source code, which build environment to use, which build commands to run, and where to store the build output.
