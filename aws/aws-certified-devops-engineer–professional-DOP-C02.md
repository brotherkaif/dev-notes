## SDLC Automation

### CI-CD Concepts

**What problems are we trying to solve?:**
These types of projects are slow, not iterative and have long release cycles.

**How do we merge the goals of Dev and Ops?:**
The traditional goals of software development and IT operations do not really align.

- **Dev:** _How many changes, features and defects can we push into production and how quickly can we do it?_
- **Ops:** _We want stable and available systems!_

**How can we solve these problems?:**
DevOps. _Shorten dev lifecycle._ Deliver features, fixes and updates frequently.

**How does DevOps look in action?:**

**What is CI/CD?:**

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment? Are they the same thing?:**

**Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of continuous devivery_.
**Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

### CodeCommit Overview

#### Key Points

**What is CodeCommit?:**

It is a _managed service_ that hosts private Git repositories.

**Why not just use Git?:**

Well, you can. But the key term is _managed service_.

#### Benefits

* Highly available, scalable and fault tolerant
* No size limit
* Integrates with other AWS services (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Lambda, SNS)
* Works with existing Git-based tools

#### Exam Tips

* CodeCommit has many benefits but _is not the only repository_ you can use in an AWS deployment pipeline.
* When in CodeCommit (or CodeBuild and CodeDeploy) in the AWS Management Console, _study the dropdowns_.
* Other repositories that can be used in AWS deployments include _S3_, _GitHub_, _Bitbucket_ and _GitHub Enterprise_.
