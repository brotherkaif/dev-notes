### CI/CD Concepts

**What problems are we trying to solve?:**
These types of projects are slow, not iterative and have long release cycles.

**How do we merge the goals of Dev and Ops?:**
The traditional goals of software development and IT operations do not really align.

- **Dev:** _How many changes, features and defects can we push into production and how quickly can we do it?_
- **Ops:** _We want stable and available systems!_

**How can we solve these problems?:**
DevOps. _Shorten dev lifecycle._ Deliver features, fixes and updates frequently.

**What is CI/CD?:**
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment? Are they the same thing?:**
No, they are not the same thing.

**Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of continuous devivery_.
**Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

**Developer Tools on AWS**
- **CodeCommit:** For our repository
- **CodeBuild:** For our build
- **CodeDeploy:** For our deployment
- **CodePipeline:** Automate and manage the above services

#### Key Points

- **Continuous Deployment:** An update is automated the whole way out to production _without the safeguards of Continuous Delivery_.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. _Key point: there is a stop for approval before going to production_.

### CodeCommit Overview

#### Key Points

> NOTE: Amazon has announced that CodeCommit is being deprecated [(read announcement)][codecommit-deprecation]. Whilst that renders this entire section redundant, it is still worth understanding the concepts as in a lot of cases, the CodeCommit repo can simply be swapped out with another third party git host.

**What is CodeCommit?:**
It is a _managed service_ that hosts private Git repositories.

**Why not just use Git?:**
Well, you can. But the key term is _managed service_.

#### Benefits

- Highly available, scalable and fault tolerant
- No size limit
- Integrates with other AWS services (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Lambda, SNS)
- Works with existing Git-based tools

#### Exam Tips

- CodeCommit has many benefits but _is not the only repository_ you can use in an AWS deployment pipeline.
- When in CodeCommit (or CodeBuild and CodeDeploy) in the AWS Management Console, _study the dropdowns_.
- Other repositories that can be used in AWS deployments include _S3_, _GitHub_, _Bitbucket_ and _GitHub Enterprise_.

### CodeCommit Repository Actions

#### AWS CLI Command Review

The following AWS CLI commands can be used to interact with CodeCommit repositories

- List Repositories: `aws codecommit list-repositories`
- Create Repository: `aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Get (View) Repository: `aws codecommit get-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`
- Delete Repository: `aws codecommit delete-repository --repository-name SomeRepoName`

#### Exam Tips

- If asked to select the proper command, note that the majority of these commands are very literal.

### CodeCommit Cloning, Commit, Pushes and Pulls

#### Exam Tips

- **Commit:** Understand that commit is committing changes to your local repository. _To get these changes to the main repository, you need to do a push._
- **Order of Operations:**
    - _Make_ changes to local files.
    - _Commit_ changes to your local repo.
    - _Push_ changes to a remote repo.

### CodeCommit Merging and Branching

- **What's the problem?:** Our developers are making changes in the same file to the same lines of code. _This cuases a conflict and needs to be sorted out._
- **What's the solution?:** _The merge process_ will help to resolve these conflicts and keep our code and our team on the same page.
- **What are Branches?:** An independant line of development. They allow us to safely make changes to code without disrupting the code on the main branch.
- **Why Branches?:**
    - To build a new feature
    - To fix bugs
    - Without disrupting the main branch

#### Exam Tips

- Three things to remember when it comes to Branches
    - Separate work
    - Work on new features
    - Create a bug fix branch

### CodeCommit Data Security

**Use CodeCommit when you need:**
- Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Managed service AWS secures
- Highly available and scalable

**Data Security Scenario**
Q: You want your development team to have full access to CodeCommit, but they should not be able to create or delete repositories.
A: Attach the AWSCodeCommit PowerUser policy to the account of each developer. Or better yet, create an IAM group to manage the developers in one place and attach that policy to the group.

#### Exam Tips

- **CodeCommit Tip:** Repositories are automatically _encrypted at rest_.
- **Repositories Tip:** Repositories _are also encrypted in transit_ using either HTTPS, SSH or both (configurable at setup).

                            |                   |                   |

                            |                   |                   |
                            |                   |                   |
Git Client: Push project to +------------------>|                   |

                            |                   |                   |
                            .                   .                   .
```

**Securing Repositories and Branches**

- **Use Case:** By default, any CodeCommit repository user who has sufficient permissions to push code to the repository can contribute to any branch in that repository. This has caused some problems and we need to limit pushes to prod to our Admins.
- **Solution:** We can create an IAM policy (or a group with a policy attached) that allows only certain users to push to the prod branch.

**Replicating Repositories Between Regions**

```
Q: How can we replicate a CodeCommit Repository across regions?

A: Create a trust, a service role that allows us to work in region 2.
   You could set up a step in your pipeline triggers a Lambda that
   executes a `git:push` to the repository in the other region.

   +-----------------------------------------------------+                        +----------------+
   |Region 1                                             |                        |Region 2        |
   |                                                     |                        |                |
   |                                                     |                        |                |

```

**Key Repository Steps**

1. Migrate a Git repository to CodeCommit
2. Branch the repository
3. Limit who can push to the `prod` repository with an IAM policy
4. Set up a pipeline to replicate our repository across regions

### Introduction to CodeBuild

**What is CodeBuild?**
Fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

**How do we access CodeBuild?**
- Management console
- CLI
- SDK
- CodePipeline

```
    SOURCE               BUILD
+------------+       +-----------+
|            |       |           | - Fully managed
|            |       |           | - No need to provision /
| CodeCommit +------>| CodeBuild |   scale servers
|            |       |           | - Prepackaged build
|            |       |           |   environments
+------------+       +-----+-----+
                           |
                           |
                           v
                        +------+
                        |      | - Versioning
                        |  S3  | - Encryption
                        |      |
                        +------+
                        ARTIFACT
```

#### Exam Tips

- **How can CodeBuild be used?:**
    - It can be added to the _build stage_ and also the test stage _in a pipeline_.
    - You must provide CodeBuild _with a build project_.
- **What is a build project?:**
    - _A build project includes_ information about how to run a build, including where to get the source code, which build environment to use, which build commands to run, and where to store the build output.


### CodeBuild Walkthrough

#### Use Cases

**Ask yourself:**

_Do you need to run CodeBuild after a successful merge to CodeCommit?_

Set up CloudWatch to monitor for merges to CodeCommit and then trigger a build in CodeBuild.

```
   +-----+
   | DEV |
   +--+--+
      |
      |
      v
+------------+
| CodeCommit |<-----+
+------------+      |
                    |
                    |
            +-------+------+
            |  CloudWatch  |
            | /EventBridge |
            |    Events    |
            +-------+------+
                    |
                    |
 +-----------+      |
 | CodeBuild |<-----+
 +-----------+
```

**You're given a new requirement:**

_You need to review CodeBuild logs and notify personnel of new logs._

- _Send CodeBuild logs to_ to CloudWatch Logs.
- _Set up a CloudWatch event_ to monitor for new logs.
- _Trigger a Lambda function_ to send a notification to Slack.

```
 +-----------+       +------------+
 | CodeBuild +------>| CloudWatch |
 +-----------+       |    Logs    |
                     +------------+


+--------------+
|  CloudWatch  |       +--------+       +-------+
| /EventBridge +------>| Lambda +------>| Slack |
|    Events    |       +--------+       +-------+
+--------------+
```

- **Input**: You must provide CodeBuild _with a build project_.
- **Output**: If there is any build output (artifacts), the build environment _uploads its output to an S3 bucket_.

#### Exam Tips

- Do you need a _build stage_?:
    - Only if your code artifacts need to be built/packaged. (e.g. For Java, you build a JAR file; whereas simple HTML does not need to be built.)
- What is a _buildspec_?:
    - _A collection of build commands and related settings_, in YAML format, the CodeBuild uses to run a build.
