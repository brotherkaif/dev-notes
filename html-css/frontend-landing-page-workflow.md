# FRONTEND: Landing Page Workflow

## Setup
1. Create your folder structure, index.html, style.css and an images folder. Load it into your editor.
2. Open the index file in your browser, also open a file browser, get your workspace sorted.

## Add HTML Content
1. Create HTML file with head, body etc.
2. Write out your content. Basic markup (don't bother with divs yet). 
3. Download any core images you need, fill out the IMG tags (aim is to have the page looking readable without styling).

## CSS Styling for Fonts & Colours
1. Add a link to your head to the CSS file.
2. Work on your CSS. Start with your colours for the body tag (both background and text). Don't go full scheme just yet.
3. Move onto fonts, pick the font family in the body, add in whatever overrides you need for the headers and stuff.
4. Sort your links out. Get rid of the decoration, make the hover nice.
5. Take a break from the page, go and find a nice colour scheme.
6. Also, go font shopping and pick some fonts and add them into the code. NOTE: it needs to come before your stylesheet link.
7. Set your fonts however you please.

## Wrap Content With DIVs & Name Your Tags
1. Move onto layout. Group content together in logical divs.
2. Start adding in id tags in html to target elements more precisely.
3. Start adding in classes for reusable targeting.

## Style DIVs
1. Start making your divs look nice. Sort the size, margin, padding, drop shadow and rounded edges.
2. Add in a background image for the banner.
3. Target the individual elements inside the banner and override their styles.

## Add in Social Icons
1. Set up Fontawesome.
2. Make your footer and use fontawesome to design add in some social media icons. Make them links, and do the usual hover and styling (don't worry about horizontal list, do that next with bootstrap).

## Make Responsive
1. Use bootstrap and merge your HTML with the boilerplate HTML template.
2. Set up the grid system. TIP: Create the container and scaffold the rows, then push in the content.
