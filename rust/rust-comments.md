# RUST: Comments

* **Single-line comments:** Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line.
* **Multi-line comments:** Multi-line comments also start with `//`

Here are some examples of comment syntax in Rust:

```rust
// This is a single-line comment.

// This is a multi-line comment.
// It can contain multiple lines of text.
```
