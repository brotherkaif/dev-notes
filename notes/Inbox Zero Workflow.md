- Types of Email
	- Action Items: Emails you need to follow up on
	- Awaiting Reply: Emails you're waiting to take action on
	- Read Through Later: Emails that contain useful info
	- Others: Archive, Mute, Snooze
- Run through each email and then move them into the relevant folder
- Once your inbox is clear, work through your folders
