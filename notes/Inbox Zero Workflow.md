# Inbox Zero Workflow
- Types of Email
	- Action Items: Emails you need to follow up on
	- Awaiting Reply: Emails you're waiting to take action on
	- Read Through Later: Emails that contain useful info
	- Others: Archive, Mute, Snooze
- Run through each email and then move them into the relevant folder
	- If you have a mute function, use it to mute noisy email threads that you have been CC'd on
	- If you have a snooze function, use it to snooze distant action items into the future where it may be more relevant
- Once your inbox is clear, work through your folders
	- Tip: you can create a "waiting" email alias that you add to the BCC field of any email you send out, then create a filter to automatically tag them as "waiting"
