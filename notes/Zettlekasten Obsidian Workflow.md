# Zettlekasten Obsidian Workflow

- Create a "Fleeting Note" for quick notes/thoughts/ideas
	- Your default "quick note"
	- Tag the notes accordingly
	- Try to keep them "atomic" (i.e. self contained and small)
	- These can be deleted if after a while they don't turn into "Permanent Notes"
- Create a "Permanant Note" when you want to keep something useful
	- Can be a polished "Fleeting Note" or a new note entirely
 - Create a "Literature Note" when you want to summarise your understanding of an area
	- Notes that you have crafted for yourself after reviewing other information
	- May contain references to a bunch of smaller "Fleeting Notes"
	- A good way of consolidating your understanding of a subject (e.g. course revision)
 - When you get enough related notes, you can then create "Map of Content"
	 - Use the tags view to identify areas that your think could be grouped together
	 - Use the template to link together notes of interest around a topic
	 - You may get questions that could lead to the creation of another "Permanent Note" so you can create one if needs be
	 - These questions can be used to direct your learning and research of an area
